Global consumers are delivering a quiet vote of no-confidence in Donald Trumpâ€™s U.S. The country where Apple Inc.â€™s iPhone was born may soon find itself in the bizarre position of shunning the global industry leader â€” a type of spiteful self-harm hardly befitting the global tech superpower."

      "summary": "Warren Buffett, chief stock-picker for Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B), is one of the most successful investors of all time. Since 1964, when he assembled the group of companies that would eventually become Berkshire, the so-called Oracle of Omaha's baby has trounced the broad market's return. That is precisely why investors hunt down so-called &quot;Warren Buffett stocks&quot; in hopes of benefiting from his wisdom and discipline.But Buffett, who turned 88 last August, has become unable to keep up the pace of study needed to keep his fund's holdings optimized, and as a result, has stepped away complete control of Berkshire Hathaway's holdings. Other acolytes - namely, Todd Combs and Ted Weschler - have emerged, and out of necessity have started making stock picks for Berkshire without necessarily requiring Buffett's blessing.Their selections aren't always divulged as non-Buffett picks. From a shareholder's perspective, Berkshire and its collective chiefs are one and the same, and reported as such. But sometimes it is clear that Warren Buffett had little-to-nothing to do with a particular holding.Here are six Berkshire Hathaway holdings that might not necessarily be &quot;Warren Buffett stocks.&quot; That's because they're out of character with the decades' worth of insight and tips he's been willing to dish out. More importantly: They might give us clues as to the direction of Berkshire's picks once Buffett is completely out of the picture. SEE ALSO: How Well Do You Really Know Warren Buffett?"

      "summary": "Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A, NYSE:BRK.B) did not just buy into Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). One of Buffett's portfolio managers bought some Amazon stock.  That will show up in the company's next 13f filing, which investors scour like Kremlinologists for hints on what they should do.Source: Shutterstock But Buffett himself didn't buy Amazon stock. He likes to say he still doesn't understand technology.So, let's help him.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAs Buffett teaches through his annual letter to shareholders, let him now learn from the letter of Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, released this week. Infrastructure Week and Amazon StockAmazon is not a &quot;phenomenon of nature,&quot; as Berkshire vice chairman Charlie Munger said recently. Amazon is a force of infrastructure, like a railroad. Clouds are infrastructure. Shared resources of any type are infrastructure. At Amazon, it's always Infrastructure Week.Jeff Bezos' most stupendous insight, headlined in his first 1997 investment letter, was that Amazon is an infrastructure company. His latest letter  illustrates the result of that insight -- 58% of Amazon's gross merchandise sales are now from independent, third-party sellers.  * 10 Cheap Stocks to Buy Now &quot;Third parties are kicking our first party butt. Badly,&quot; he writes. They know their customers better than Amazon's sales algorithms know them. By giving third-party sellers access to all of Amazon's infrastructure -- its cloud, its transaction processing, its tax calculation, its warehousing and shipping -- these sellers can focus on what matters to them and to their retail customers.Clouds are the most important, and profitable, form of new infrastructure. Clouds, when used not just by those who built them but by everyone, drive up productivity and create deflation like nothing else we've seen. Now that its cloud infrastructure is largely in place, Amazon can bring nearly 30% of cloud revenue to the net income line.Once any critical infrastructure is in place, that becomes an enormous profit engine. In its first-quarter report, Amazon earned $3.56 billion, $7.09 per share fully diluted, on revenue of $59.7 billion. Sales were up 17%, but profits more than doubled, compared with a year earlier.It's this critical, privately owned infrastructure that made Sen. Elizabeth Warren put a target on Amazon's back. Bezos alludes to this in his letter, a topic I covered in my own newsletter this week. &quot;Retailing is no longer the monopoly Walmart (NYSE:WMT) threatened to make it 25 years ago,&quot; when the Web was first being spun, I wrote. &quot;The difference is Amazon.&quot; (Buffett recently sold out his Walmart position.) Scaling FailureThere's a second important point in Bezos' latest letter -- that failure should scale as well as success. &quot;If the size of your failures isn't growing, you're not going to be inventing at a size that can actually move the needle,&quot; he writes. The Fire phone failed but Echo, the two-way speaker launched at the same time, became a huge success.Amazon's Alexa voice interface, which lives between the Echo and the Amazon cloud, has become a new kind of operating system. In the next decade, you might not find yourself bumping into people staring into their phones. You may find yourself bumping into people staring into space and talking seemingly to themselves as they interface with the Alexa operating system. As Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) has learned, you can make serious coin with an operating system. The Bottom Line for AMZN StockI feel about Amazon much like Jim Cramer has long felt about Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Amazon is not a stock you trade. Amazon is a stock you own.Amazon's infrastructure delivers enormous opportunities for it to try things and make mistakes. Its spending on content was $1.7 billion last quarter, even though only half of Prime members watch what it streams, even though Apple and Spotify (NASDAQ:SPOT) continue to kick its butt in music streaming.Forget what Amazon will do with a promise of one-day Prime shipping. Think about what Amazon's business customers will do with it.Dana Blankenhorn is a financial and technology journalist.

      "summary": "[Editor's note: This story was previously published in March 2019. It has since been updated and republished.]The tech sector endured some pretty tough times last year. Even Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) struggled.But if we put these troubles aside for a moment and focus on the longer-term outlook, a different picture emerges. Stretching out to 2025, some of these big-name tech stocks begin to look very attractive indeed -- especially at their current price levels.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIn order to pinpoint which tech stocks will be leading the way seven years from now, I turned to a recent report from RBC Capital. Its &quot;Imagine 2025&quot; portfolio selects the tech stocks the firm believes will be winning on a long-term basis. &quot;We believe the following names are best positioned to outperform over a seven-year time horizon through 2025&quot; writes the firm.What does this mean for now? It means longer-term investors should think twice before selling the stocks listed below, while other investors may want to keep a close eye on the following stocks as potential buy on the dip opportunities.  * 10 Cheap Stocks to Buy Now Here are the top tech stocks primed to outperform over the next few years:Source: Shutterstock  Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL)As I said above, Alphabet has not been immune to the market's choppiness.But at the end of the day this is still a killer stock pick with a &quot;strong buy&quot; analyst consensus on TipRanks. This is with a $1,346 average analyst price target.&quot;AMZN and GOOGL, in particular, appear to have invested the most in AI competencies and have the Big Data access and Compute Power infrastructure to benefit most from AI and ML developments&quot; writes RBC Capital.And Google has an extra string on its bow: its self-driving car unit Waymo. Alphabet disclosed that Waymo reached the 10 million miles of autonomous vehicle driving milestone.&quot;GOOGL appears particularly well situated to lead autonomous vehicle innovations, given its substantial investments in Waymo autonomous vehicle technology&quot; cheers the firm.Luckily for Alphabet, RBC believes autonomous vehicles will be arguably one of the biggest applications of AI.Interested in GOOGL stock? Get a free GOOGL Stock Research Report.Source: Shutterstock  Nvidia (NVDA)Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is pushing the boundaries of technology and this should pay off over the years to come.Even though Nvidia is suffering over the last six months, the long-term picture remains very compelling.For example, Jefferies analyst Mark Lipacis (Track Record & Ratings) calls the January quarter a setback. However he says Nvidia remains &quot;a top play on secular themes&quot; in AI, gaming and autonomous vehicles. He tells investors to &quot;buy the confession.&quot;&quot;While there are no guarantees of a winner in the AI race, we think Nvidia is well ahead of its peers and is continuing to gain traction due primarily to the value of Cuda software&quot; says RBC Capital. It estimates over one million engineers working with Cuda and calls it &quot;the secret sauce that underlies the entire ecosystem.&quot; Get the NVDA Stock Research Report.Source: Shutterstock  Amazon (AMZN)You probably aren't surprised to see Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) on this list. The ecommerce company is consistently innovating for the future, be it through acquisitions, technology or entering new markets.One interesting advancement for the company is in the field of robotics. &quot;Amazon appears particularly well situated to lead robotics innovations, given its ongoing investment in Kiva logistics robots&quot; points out RBC Capital.The company already deploys something to the tune of 100K Kiva robots, basically a robot army. And it's now looking increasingly likely that a very large percentage of Amazon's distribution workforce will be complemented with these robots by 2025.As RBC concludes, the impact of this should be greater operational efficiency for AMZN stock.Another interesting trend to consider: AI-powered Voice Recognition will likely improve significantly from current levels, allowing even better use of internet apps via voice commands. Again, Amazon should be a major beneficiary of this trend.Notably, AMZN boasts one of the best ratings on the Street. This comes with a $2,215 average analyst price target. Get the AMZN Stock Research Report.Source: Shutterstock  Rapid7 (RPD)If you are looking for a cheaper long-term stock, look no further. Rapid7 (NASDAQ:RPD) uses a unique data- and analytics-driven approach to cyber security.The stock is highlighted by RBC as an attractive name in the cybersecurity space, particularly following the recent acquisition of Komand. The company snapped up Komand in 2017 to boost its security orchestration and automation offering.&quot;The need for well-designed security and IT automation solutions is acute; resources are scarce, environments are becoming more complex, all while threats are increasing,&quot; says Corey Thomas, CEO of Rapid7.  * 10 Cheap Stocks to Buy Now &quot;Security and IT solutions must evolve through context-driven automation, allowing cybersecurity and IT professionals to focus on more strategic activities.&quot;Plus RBC's Matthew Hedberg (Track Record & Ratings) is behind the stock. &quot;Success has continued to highlight the power of the platform approach with impressive cross-sell metrics driven by combining security and IT Ops&quot; concludes the analyst. Get the RPD Stock Research Report.Source:  Web Summit Via Flickr Splunk (SPLK)&quot;Within our software universe, we would highlight Splunk (NASDAQ:SPLK) as a likely winner in the big data category&quot; writes RBC Capital.Splunk basically turns machine data into answers. It produces software for searching, monitoring and analyzing machine-generated big data, via a web-style interface.In part, these answers are generated through the firm's machine learning system. Splunk provides the Machine Learning Toolkit, a guided workbench to create and test flexible models that can handle any use case.&quot;A key value of creating models in Splunk is that users can seamlessly apply them to real-time machine data&quot; says RBC Capital.Plus RBC isn't the only firm singing the stock's praises. This &quot;strong buy&quot; stock has a $155 average analyst price target. Get the SPLK Stock Research Report.Source: Shutterstock  PayPal (PYPL)If we turn to financial tech stocks, analysts are upbeat on&quot;moderate buy&quot; stock PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) right now. This is with a $1117 average analyst price target.First of all, PayPal offers massive scale. And second it boasts a unique two-sided model among tech stocks, with both consumers and merchants onside. This means the company can control the entire consumer experience.&quot;PayPal's unique assets enable the company to tap into the long-term global shift to digital commerce&quot; says RBC Capital.  * 10 Cheap Stocks to Buy Now Plus the firm sees the company as a champion of democratizing finance around the globe. &quot;We believe its growing platform of assets will open up the ~2B people around the world who lack financial services.&quot;Similarly top Oppenheimer analyst Glenn Greene (Track Record & Ratings) notes PYPL's &quot;unique&quot; competitive position. He is even more confident in the stock following recent partnerships, and anticipates high-teens revenue growth and 20%-plus EPS growth for the next several years. Get the PYPL Stock Research Report.Source: Shutterstock  Apple (AAPL)RBC Capital sees a long runway for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock.&quot;We think AAPL could be a major beneficiary of AI and VR/AR-related trends, which could generate significant tailwinds for its services business&quot; it writes. It notes that the latest iPhones are equipped with the ability to recognize patterns, make predictions and learn from experiences.What's even more interesting is that by 2025 we could be looking at the first real &quot;iPhone generation.&quot; 2025 is 18 years from the launch of the first iPhone.For people who grew up with iOS devices, Apple could have data on every app a person installed, on every flight, book and purchase, as well as academic records, health statistics, family background and more.Now imagine an AI trained on this data set. &quot;This AI would truly be a 'personal' assistant. A hyper -customized neural network that would be so powerful, it would make an existing services pool very strong and usher in a host of new offerings that can only be imagined&quot; says the firm. Get the AAPL Stock Research Report.Source: Shutterstock  Synopsys (SNPS)This chip stock is pretty much a guaranteed winner of future tech trends. Someone needs to design AI chips and that someone is Synopsys (NASDAQ:SNPS).Synopsys is essentially an &quot;arms dealer&quot; for AI and all things chip related says RBC Capital.&quot;By helping design complex chips, Synopsys is in the thick of AI in terms of design&quot; the firm writes. And the best part is that it doesn't even matter what new companies come along they will still need Synopsys.&quot;As new and existing companies continue to push the edge of technology, Synopsys will be helping the companies design each chip regardless of it being a GPU, CPU, FPGA, Digital Chip, Analog chip or otherwise&quot; the firm explains.  * 10 Cheap Stocks to Buy Now Even now, the stock looks bullish with a &quot;strong buy&quot; analyst consensus and $109 average analyst price target. Get the SNPS Stock Research Report.Source: Shutterstock  Micron (MU)A second chip stock to consider: Micron (NASDAQ:MU). All future trends result in data creation and Micron is perfectly positioned for this with its DRAM/NAND memory portfolio.&quot;The incredible amount of data generated by AI, AR/VR and autonomous driving would require significantly higher memory, both NAND and DRAM, leading to strong and long-term tailwinds for MU&quot; writes RBC Capital.Plus we could be looking at a compelling entry point. Indeed, Deutsche Bank's Sidney Ho (Track Record & Ratings) points out that shares appear cheaper right now. He has just reiterated his &quot;buy&quot; rating with a $60 price target.And the tech stock still retains its &quot;moderate buy&quot; analyst consensus rating. This is with a $54 price target. Get the MU Stock Research Report.Source: Shutterstock  Microsoft (MSFT)Last but not least, make sure to make room for Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). This is a company that ticks all the boxes when it comes to future trends.&quot;Leading hyperscale hybrid cloud platform with big runway of growth in AI, IoT, Gaming and other services&quot; explains RBC on the stock's inclusion in its 2025 portfolio.Like GOOGL and AMZN, MSFT stock benefits from 1) massive amounts of raw compute power; 2) large data sets; and 3) ability to hire the smartest data scientists on the planet.It picks Microsoft as the No. 1 AI company in the public cloud space. This is thanks to the company's rapidly growing Azure cloud platform.&quot;We believe Microsoft is in an enviable position vs other public cloud competitors as their customers can also leverage AI and ML capabilities on premise, something [Amazon's] AWS and [Google's] GCP can't deliver natively&quot; points out RBC Capital.  * 10 Cheap Stocks to Buy Now Also note the stock's killer &quot;strong buy&quot; rating with 20 out of 21 analysts bullish on the stocks prospects. Top this off with a $142 average analyst price target for upside of 17% and I would say Microsoft is one of the most appealing tech stocks to buy and hold onto!

      "publication_date": "2019-05-03T16:39:52.000Z",
      "url": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/roku-stock-still-not-squeamish-163952379.html?.tsrc=rss",
      "summary": "Last June I called Roku (NASDAQ:ROKU) an &quot;interesting speculative play&quot;  and if you put money into ROKU stock then, you've been on a rollercoaster.Source: Roku Roku stock price more than doubled to $75 by October, at which point I said Roku was &quot;poised to retreat.&quot; By Christmas, the stock was down in the mid-20s. If you took my June advice but ignored October, you were unhappy.But there was another turnaround coming, and by February I noted that &quot;everybody suddenly loves Roku stock,&quot;  with the shares just below $50 each.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 3 Earnings Reports to Watch Next Week Everybody did love it, because by March Roku was at $70. It has since been bouncing around. Currently, ROKU trades around $64. So you might be wondering what I think the shares will do next. Pay AttentionThe point here isn't that I'm a stock price savant. The point is that Roku shares are highly volatile, driven by the shifting moods of traders, and you must pay careful attention to them.Generally, however, the direction of Roku stock has been up. Shares are up over 90% over the last year, even with last fall's collapse, and for good reason. Roku doubled its quarterly revenue from March to the end of the year, operating cash flow has been positive for three straight quarters, and there's no debt.Roku next reports May 8, and the number looks easy to beat. Revenues of $189 million, down by one-third from the Christmas quarter, and a loss of 24 cents per share is expected. Roku's business model is to sell streaming devices, then offer other streams and its own ad-based services on top of it. Rokus were a popular Christmas present, but you don't buy Christmas presents in February, so only part of the business is expected to be performing when Roku reports next month. Land of the GiantsRoku's ad business, meanwhile, lives in a land of giants, one where Roku's market cap of $7.1 billion is puny. The stick is offered directly against devices from Amazon.Com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL). Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has gotten more serious about the business with Apple TV. The big cable operators, like Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) and AT&T (NYSE:T), see streaming sticks as competitors, and everyone these days seems to have their own ad-supported streaming channel.Analysts, however, feel Roku is on firmer footing than before, a sure winner as consumers keep cutting their cable cords. Never mind that those cords are not being entirely cut. Those consumers are still on Internet service contracts, and the providers are not prevented from favoring their own offerings over any competitor.Even hedge fund operators, who are supposed to be smart, don't know what to do with Roku.  They got into it during its spectacular rise, but most stayed for the spectacular fall. The numbers are still coming in on how many got into the latest rise, but the stock's choppiness over the last month, down 10% from its early April high, indicates they're as confused as we are. The Bottom Line for Roku StockRoku remains a trader's stock, not a long-term investment. It's a stock you must pay attention to if you're to maximize your profit.But its fate seems clear. There are just too many big companies out there who might want it. These include the cable giants, the cloud czars and even some broadcasters desperate for a new way into consumer wallets.Personally, I think Roku would fit very nicely inside Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS). But the valuation is still so low even CBS (NYSE:CBS), with a market cap of $19 billion, could afford it. Which means the auction, once it starts, should be fun.  * 10 Cheap Stocks to Buy Now If I'm buying Roku stock today, the takeout is my payoff.Dana Blankenhorn is a financial and technology journalist.

      "summary": "The Securities and Exchange Commission settled charges with an Apple Inc. vendor, the New Hampshire-based company GT Advanced Technologies Inc., and its former CEO for misleading investors about the company&apos;s ability to supply &quot;sapphire glass&quot; for Apple&apos;s iPhones. GT Advanced Technologies Inc., also allegedly misclassified more than $300 million in debt to Apple that resulted from its repeated failures to meet performance milestones. In the fall of 2013, according to the SEC, Apple agreed to advance $578 million in four installments to GT in exchange for sapphire glass that met certain technical standards. The agreement was closely watched by the market and highly material to GT&apos;s revenue, liabilities, and stock value. By late April 2014, GT had failed to meet the required standards, resulting in Apple withholding $139 million and giving it the right to accelerate repayment of $306 million previously advanced to GT. To avoid recognizing the debt as current, GT took an unsupported, undisclosed position that Apple had breached part of the agreement, thus releasing the company from the contract. However, then-CEO Thomas Gutierrez falsely stated in an earnings call that GT expected to hit performance targets and receive the last payment from Apple by October 2014. Gutierrez also provided unsupported sales projections, causing GT to misstate its second-quarter liquidity and non-GAAP earnings-per-share projections. Within two months, GT filed for bankruptcy and is now privately held. GT and Gutierrez consented to the settlement without admitting or denying the allegations and Gutierrez agreed to pay more than $140,000."

The European Union has been in the forefront of efforts to tighten control on how social media companies handle the personal data of consumers, with  rules introduced last May giving regulators the power to impose fines of up to 4 percent of global revenue for violations."

      "url": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/disappointing-nokia-stock-solid-dividend-114039277.html?.tsrc=rss",
      "summary": "Amid seemingly improving fortunes, Nokia (NYSE:NOK) continues to suffer. Nokia stock fell by 10% after its quarterly report. Traders sold NOK amid earnings and revenue misses. Investors keep waiting for the predicted increase in revenue and earnings brought about by the rise of 5G. This latest report leaves many wondering if it will ever happen.Source: Shutterstock As a result, many see some of Nokia's peers as better investments. However, despite the struggles, a buy case for a specific type of investor remains. Lost Confidence and Nokia stockTo be sure, NOK stock has become a frustrating equity. I had taken a bullish on Nokia due to 5G. However, the latest earnings report has forced me to admit that the profit rollout has come more slowly than expected.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsInvestorPlace contributor Vince Martin wonders if those profits will ever appear. He believes Nokia suffers because of a trust problem within the Finland-based company.  * The 10 Best Stocks to Buy for May He may be right.Nokia has kept its guidance steady for both 2019 and 2020. But that also leaves investors wondering if 5G profits will actually start coming in the second half of the year.Nokia has missed opportunities since at least 2007. At that time, this leading cellphone company failed to see the future. As a result, it saw its business quickly evaporate soon after Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) released its iPhone.Also, as Martin correctly points out, the merger with Alcatel-Lucent has met with declines in Nokia stock. The stock suffered further in March when the company revealed that some transactions with the Alcatel-Lucent division faced compliance issues.To its credit, NOK has transformed itself into a 5G equipment provider. However, it seems to lack the drive to succeed in its new industry. Political pressures have all but eliminated Huawei as an option in many countries. Unfortunately for investors in Nokia stock, the company has not benefitted from the reduced competition. Nokia Is Falling BehindOn the other hand, eliminating a major rival has boosted Ericsson's (NASDAQ:ERIC) numbers. Ericsson stock rose by 7.3% after it announced an earnings and revenue beat in its last quarterly report.Its 17.8 forward price-to-earnings (PE) ratio comes in higher. Still, that appears cheap in light of expected profit growth of more than 272% this year and a predicted 31.7% earnings increase in 2020.It also lags firms such as Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) in other areas of networking. Double-digit profit growth, a 16.4 forward PE ratio, and the track record of dividend increases make Cisco a viable option. Dividend Investors and Nokia StockDespite these metrics from its peers, I see a case for buying Nokia stock, at least for dividend investors. The 24-cent per share annual dividend yields about 4.6% at current prices.Given the expected demand for 5G, I do not see Nokia's financials warranting a dividend cut. Moreover, it surpasses Cisco's yield of around 2.6% as well as Ericsson's which comes in at about 1.2%. The payout also gives investors some return even if it remains rangebound.Furthermore, Nokia's forward PE comes in at about 13. If it fulfills some of its potential as a 5G equipment provider, profits should finally rise. That could take it above $7 per share, a price level it has not surpassed since 2015. Concluding Thoughts on Nokia StockAmid the struggles, the buy case for Nokia remains lucrative for dividend investors. Nokia's latest earnings and revenue miss confirmed some long-held negative feelings about NOK stock.In recent weeks, compliance issues have weighed on NOK. Moreover, missing on revenue and earnings even with less competition has many investors perplexed. This has arguably made a case for investors to choose Ericsson or Cisco over Nokia.Nonetheless, Nokia leads its peers by a wide margin on dividend yields. Moreover, the rise of 5G will likely push NOK higher despite itself. Even if Nokia fails to produce stellar earnings reports, the cash payouts should keep dividend investors happy for the foreseeable future.As of this writing, Will Healy did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned stocks.

      "url": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fitbit-stock-tumbles-despite-reporting-175520052.html?.tsrc=rss",
      "summary": "Fitbit (NYSE:FIT) reported Q1 earnings with some good news for investors. The company beat analyst expectations on revenue, sold 36% more devices than last year and saw its trackers post year-over-year unit growth for the first time in three years. Its Health Solutions business saw 70% growth. On a less positive note, ASP dropped and the company still lost 31 cents per share.Source: Fitbit Investors' reaction was mostly positive and Fitbit stock continued its 2019 roller coaster ride, closing up 1.7% and gaining an additional 2.4% in pre-market trading. However, it has since fallen back to earth, down 4.6% at the time of this writing.On May 1, Fitbit released its Q1 earnings report. For FIT investors there was more good news in there than they have become accustomed to hearing. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsRevenue was up 10% year-over-year, and it was the result in sales growth across all the company's product lines. Even fitness trackers -- Fitbit says unit sales of its smartwatches grew 117% year-over-year. That's more than holding their own against the market leader Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Watch. In addition, sales for fitness trackers saw 17% growth on the year. That's worth spiking out because it marks the first time in three years that Fitbit has seen growth in this segment.In addition, the company's Health Solutions division, which InvestorPlace contributor Larry Ramer noted as a key factor in the potential for a Fitbit stock rally, saw year-over-year revenue growth of 70%.Overall, Fitbit sold 2.9 million devices in Q1 (up 36% year-over-year), which handily beat analyst expectations of 2 million. In addition, the $271.9 million in revenue for the quarter also exceeded the $259.7 million that analysts were projecting.  * 10 Cheap Stocks to Buy in May, But Don't Go Away The degree of growth in sales numbers and the surprise signs of life in the fitness trackers category naturally boosted Fitbit stock, which closed up 1.7% and has been trading up an additional 2.42% in the pre-market. But There Are Some Concerns While FIT's Q1 numbers had some real positives for the struggling company, they also revealed some potential causes for concern. Specifically average sales price (ASP). That number fell rather dramatically. And earnings, which remained in the red, with an average loss per share of 31 cents (although that was an improvement over the 34 cents loss per share in Q1 2018). When you look at the growth in devices and compare it to the growth in revenue, the numbers don't quite add up. You would expect the revenue numbers to be even higher. The reason they aren't is that Fitbit has begun to compete aggressively on price. The company introduced a new Inspire line of inexpensive fitness trackers earlier this year with prices starting at just $69.95 along with a stripped down version of its Versa smartwatch (the Versa Lite Edition) which has a $159.95 price tag.  * 7 of the Best ETFs to Buy for a Slowing Economy Where analysts were looking for an ASP in the $109 range, Fitbit reported an ASP of $91 per device. The strategy of targeting value-conscious consumers has the potential to pay off. If Fitbit can keep growing unit sales this way, it can expand its platform and the growth in its user base would make the company's Health Solutions division more attractive to big clients like insurance companies.The downside is margins drop and the company has to sell a lot more devices to be profitable. The margin pressure was evident in the Q1 earnings report, which saw gross margins shrink from 46% a year ago to 32.9% in Q1 2019.Fitbit remains in a tough position. It's fighting for smartwatch market share against Apple and Samsung, and trying to re-ignite consumer interest in fitness trackers -a market where Xiaomi has become dominant by selling Mi bands starting at just $30. If the company's new strategy of cutting prices pays off with sustained sales growth and further inroads into the corporate health market, that will be good news for Fitbit stock. If not, FIT investors can expect the roller coaster ride to continue.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.
